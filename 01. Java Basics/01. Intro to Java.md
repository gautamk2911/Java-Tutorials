# Introduction to Java

![Java Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg)

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, Android apps, web servers, and more.

## Why Learn Java?

- **Platform Independent**: Java applications are compiled into bytecode which can run on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Object-Oriented**: Encourages modular programs and reusable code.
- **Robust and Secure**: Strong memory management and built-in security features.
- **Large Community**: Active community, extensive documentation, and lots of third-party libraries.
- **Versatile**: Used in desktop, web, mobile, and embedded systems.

## Features of Java

- **Simple**
- **Object-Oriented**
- **Platform Independent**
- **Secure**
- **Robust**
- **Multithreaded**
- **Architecture-Neutral**
- **Portable**

## Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

- **JDK**: Includes tools for developing Java programs (compiler, debugger, etc.)
- **JRE**: Contains the libraries and JVM needed to run Java applications

## Hello World Program in Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## How Java Works

1. Write code in `.java` file
2. Compile with `javac` to produce `.class` bytecode
3. Run with `java` command using the JVM

## Real-World Applications of Java

- **Android Applications**
- **Web Applications (using Spring, JSP, Servlets)**
- **Enterprise Software**
- **Scientific Applications**
- **Big Data Technologies (like Hadoop)**

## Getting Started with Java

1. Download and install JDK from [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
2. Set up environment variables
3. Use a text editor or IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
4. Compile and run your first program
