# ‚òï Java  Abstraction & Encapsulation


- üß± **Encapsulation** ‚Äì Wrapping data and methods together with restricted access
- üé≠ **Abstraction** ‚Äì Hiding the complexity, exposing only the essentials

# Encapsulation

### ‚úÖ What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the OOP principle of **binding variables (data)** and **methods** that operate on the data into a single unit, and **restricting access** to some of the object's components.

> Think of encapsulation as placing the internal workings of a system into a protective capsule.

### üîë Key Characteristics:

- Uses **access modifiers** to control visibility
- Promotes **data hiding**
- Offers **public getters and setters** to access private data
- Enhances **modularity, maintainability**, and **security**

---

### üîß Example: Basic Encapsulation with Getters and Setters

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age > 0) this.age = age;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

### ‚ú® Benefits:
- Protects data from outside interference
- Allows validation logic before setting values
- Makes code cleaner and easier to manage

---

### üí™ Advanced Concept: Immutable Classes

Immutable classes are fully encapsulated classes whose state **cannot be changed** once created.

```java
public final class Employee {
    private final String name;

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

Useful in multithreading, secure data transfer, and functional programming.

# Abstraction

### ‚úÖ What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is the concept of **hiding internal implementation details** and showing only the **functionality** to the user.

> Think of a TV remote: you press buttons without knowing the electronic logic inside.

### ‚ú® Java Supports Abstraction Through:
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Interfaces**

---

### üîÄ Abstract Classes

- Cannot be instantiated
- Can contain **both abstract and non-abstract methods**
- Used for **partial abstraction**

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void makeSound();

    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

### üî† Interfaces

- Provide **full abstraction** (100% until Java 8)
- Cannot have instance variables
- All methods are **public and abstract** by default (until Java 8)
- Support **multiple inheritance**

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

interface Swimmable {
    void swim();
}

class Duck implements Flyable, Swimmable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Duck flies");
    }
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Duck swims");
    }
}
```

### üåü Java 8 Enhancements:

```java
interface Vehicle {
    default void fuelType() {
        System.out.println("Petrol or Diesel");
    }

    static void speedLimit() {
        System.out.println("Max speed is 120km/hr");
    }
}
```

## üìä Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature               | Abstract Class           | Interface                      |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Method Implementation | Can have both             | Abstract only (Java 7)          |
| Constructors          | Yes                       | No                             |
| Multiple Inheritance  | Not supported             | Supported                      |
| Variables             | Can have instance vars    | Only constants (static + final) |
| Access Modifiers      | Any                       | Only public                    |

## üß† Real-World Analogies

- **Encapsulation**: Medical capsule with internal ingredients hidden
- **Abstraction**: Car dashboard hiding engine complexity

## üéØ Practice Exercises

1. Create a class `BankAccount` with private fields and getter/setter methods.
2. Build an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract `area()` method and concrete `display()` method.
3. Implement an interface `Playable` with a `play()` method and classes `Guitar`, `Piano` that implement it.
4. Add a static and default method in an interface `Driveable`.
